# HelloThere
 "My first repository on GitHub."
 Lets be honest, not many people enjoy describing themselves, it's pretty damn uncomfortable and a little bit awkward. So i left it up to my Facebook peoples to describe me in a phrase and this is what i got... 

-Vivacious 
-A creative firecracker
-A confident yet beautiful presence that attracts the attention of the room, while maintaining flares of sass & wit (I should buy this person a sandwich or something as a thank you)
-Jafar (you know that evil villain from Aladdin? Well I can frown like him)
-Fun and sweet even when raising one eyebrow (also Jafar like)
-Open-minded 
-Loves dogs (some would say to the point of obsession)
-Bold, sarcastic
-Boundless & fearless 
-Quirky, goofy, artistic, talkative, & caring
-Bold, sarcastic, and lanky (I resemble gumbo meaning I'm comprised of limbs)
-Outspoken dog enthusiast
